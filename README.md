# Dulzia

Website developed as part of an academic activity for the subject **Administración de Recursos** at **UTN-FRT**. This project consists of creating a fictional corporate identity based on the company **Arcor**, adapting its mission, vision, and values for an invented brand: **Dulzia**. The main objective was to apply strategic planning knowledge in a realistic context.

## Project Description

**Dulzia** is an imaginary company in the food sector, focused on the production of candies, chocolates, and functional foods. Its image and value proposition are inspired by Arcor, but with its own identity.

This website is designed as a simple and adaptable **corporate landing page** that showcases:

- The company's **Mission and Vision**
- Institutional values defined under the acronym **PODIO**
- Fictitious products
- A **simulated contact form** (no real functionality)
- Video as part of the page design

## Main Features
### Mission

Create quality foods that accompany people at every stage of life, generating memorable experiences through innovation, flavor, and a commitment to sustainability.

### Vision

Be a leading company in the Latin American food industry, globally recognized for its operational excellence, social responsibility, and capacity for continuous innovation.

### PODIO Values

**P**lanificación  
**O**rganización  
**D**irección  
**I**ntegración  
**O-C**ontrol  

Each of these values comes with a detailed explanation on the site, applied to areas such as expansion, organizational structure, leadership, loyalty, and innovation. Briefly, PODIO stands for Planning, Organization, Direction, Integration, and **O-C**ontrol — a guiding framework applied to expansion, organizational structure, leadership, loyalty, and innovation.

## Development Team

This site was developed by Facundo Moya, a student of **Ingeniería en Sistemas de Información** at the **Universidad Tecnológica Nacional – Facultad Regional Tucumán (UTN-FRT)**, as a course project for **Administración de Recursos**.

The work is based on a fictitious company (Dulzia) inspired by Arcor, following its mission/vision structure and adapting the values under the custom acronym PODIO.

## Code Management

The project was developed using a simple Git workflow where:

- **Single active branch**: `master` (now called `main` in many repositories)
